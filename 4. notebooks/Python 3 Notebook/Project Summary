## Project Summary

### What Was Done
- **Data Cleaning:** Imported and cleaned Netflix content, ratings, users, and view history datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explored dataset shapes, checked for missing values, and merged relevant tables.
- **Visualizations:** Created bar plots and histograms to analyze top content, genre distribution, user watch time, ratings distribution, and user signup trends.

### Key Findings
- **Top Genres:** Thriller, Romance, and Documentary are the most-watched genres.
- **User Trends:** User watch time varies widely, with some users watching significantly more than others. User signups are distributed throughout the year.
- **Content Insights:** Identified the most-watched and highest-rated content (with at least 10 ratings).

### Tools Used
- **Python** for data analysis and scripting
- **pandas** for data manipulation
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis

### Next Steps
- **Predictive Modeling:** Build models to predict user ratings or recommend content based on user preferences.
- **Recommendation System:** Implement collaborative or content-based filtering to suggest shows to users.
