📌 Netflix-Inspired Streaming Analytics Project
Tools: Python, PostgreSQL, SQL, Tableau, Power BI
Role: Data Analyst / BI Analyst with Data Engineering Elements

Designed and implemented a full-stack analytics solution simulating a media streaming platform’s data environment

Built relational data models and created ER diagrams for user, content, viewing, and ratings datasets using PostgreSQL

Developed and executed SQL scripts to clean, transform, and join data for analysis

Conducted exploratory analysis in Python to uncover churn patterns, top-performing content, and usage trends

Created interactive dashboards in Tableau and Power BI to visualize KPIs like watch time, engagement, and retention

Integrated foundational data engineering tasks including data schema design, ETL logic, and pipeline structuring

Documented the project for GitHub to highlight practical analytics, BI, and architecture skills for portfolio use
