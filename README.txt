Netflix-Inspired Streaming Analytics Platform
End-to-end analytics project simulating a media streaming platform’s data environment — covering data architecture, transformation pipelines, exploratory analytics, and business dashboards for churn risk, engagement, and content performance.

Project Summary
Tools: PostgreSQL, Python, Tableau, Power BI Role: Data Analyst / BI Analyst with Data Engineering Tasks

Designed and implemented a full-stack analytics pipeline inspired by Netflix’s data ecosystem
Modeled relational schemas and created ER diagrams for users, content, viewing behavior, and ratings
Built SQL queries to extract total watch time, churn signals, user segmentation, and signup trends
Used Python for ETL processing, churn metrics, and exploratory analysis
Created Tableau and Power BI dashboards to visualize content performance, user retention, and regional insights
Delivered a portfolio-ready solution integrating storytelling, KPIs, and audience insights

Key Business Questions Explored
User Behavior How does total watch time vary across users, and what viewing behaviors signal low or high engagement?
Churn Analysis Which regions show higher churn risk, and how should retention strategies differ by geography?
Content Strategy What shows are driving the most total watch time and completion? 
Which genres underperform in ratings?
Acquisition Trends Are there seasonal patterns in user signups? What’s the trajectory of platform growth over time?
Viewer Sentiment What genres receive the highest average user ratings? How does this influence curation strategy?
